  "description" : "I will probably release a raw mod, and call it \"beta test\". I am a genius, amn`t I, Ubisoft?\n\nAnyway, that's a beta test of my mod. Currently it`s 0.4.3\nFirst letter will become 1 after release, 2nd will go +1 every bow added, and 3rd after every patch.\n(Steam does NOT auto update mods/ tell you to update them, so subscribe to the comments section, I will leave comment every update there)\nWhat do I have:\n\n4 Bows for start-, mid- and end-game.\nLegit crafting for all of them (at least for two, another one will have to grow (I mean bow, not recipe))\nCustom projectiles and well done small details (as much as i can)\n\nIN CASE OF GAME CRASHING:\ncontact me in comments/directly. We will try to solve it together\n\nIf you want to help me:\nI am lacking in ideas, write any suggestions in comments",
